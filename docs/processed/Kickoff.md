Protective Life intends to explore how conversational voice automation can improve its  TeleLife  interview process by developing an AI agent capable of conducting phone interviews with prospective customers.

During a 8-week proof-of-concept, we will build and evaluate a fully conversational voice agent. This agent will follow the  TeleLife  questionnaire, record responses in real time, manage deviations from the standard interview flow, and generate completed interview records.

The objective is not only to demonstrate the art of the possible through the proof-of-concept, but to also, at a high-level, capture prerequisites for future scaling, and present the Protective leadership with a summary document to take this initiative further. 

 

Building the Future of Protective's  TeleLife  Experience through Conversational Voice Automation

Voice Agent Development and Demonstration Create a conversational voice agent that performs  TeleLife  interviews using the structured questionnaire and automatically generates summaries of responses. Showcase live interaction, decision-based branching, and automated summary collection while evaluating accuracy within a sandbox environment using synthetic data.

Executive Summary Document & Readout                                                 Executive synthesis of proof-of-concept results, highlighting demonstrated capabilities, technical feasibility, lessons learned, and recommended next steps for a scaled  TeleLife  voice automation roadmap.

Our proposed Deliverables :

Validate conversational voice automation in Protective's  TeleLife  process

Provide measurable insights on process feasibility for AI

Identify high-level business and technical prerequisites for scaled deployment

Humanlike

Conversations that  feel natural and fluid , closer to how client speak with a person than a machine.

- Natural, fluid conversations instead of scripted, rigid menus
- Reduce repeats/misunderstandings through free-form intent capture
- Adaptive summaries and clarifiers phrased in plain language

Empathetic

Interactions that  recognizes client emotion and intent , responding with care and acknowledgment, not just answers.

- Adjust tone with sentiment and emotion signals
- Use micro-cues to reassure and acknowledge problems or effort
- Pass emotional context forward to agents

Personalized

Experiences  tailored to each client's history, needs, and preferences ; no "one-size-fits-all."

- Adapt flows by caller profile and history
- Tailor nudges and clarifiers based on proponent segment
- Provide human agents with personalization suggestions
- 

Concentrating on four key design principles  enables agentic agents to deliver reliable, high-quality client experiences while enhancing efficiency within Protective's existing workflow.

Contextualized

Interactions are  grounded in company-specific knowledge ,  recent activity , and  signals  so responses are always relevant and trusted.

- Ground answers in trusted Knowledge AI sources
- Weave in recent activity, past intents, and journey state
- Deliver full context to agents at handoff

These four principles act as a  decision litmus test :

If a generative/agentic AI feature or experiment doesn't make the bot more humanlike, empathetic, personalized, or contextualized, we shouldn't invest in it.

As Protective has a Microsoft ecosystem, we will start there and explore future integrations but not be constrained by them. 

- Incoming calls are handled through  Azure Communication Services (ACS) , triggering real-time audio events via  Event Grid .
- The  Call Center Voice Agent , hosted on  Azure Container Apps , manages call flow and interacts with Azure AI Voice Live APIs for ASR/TTS.
- A  RAG service  (document ingestion, embeddings, vector DB, retrieval, re-ranking) grounds responses in Protective's  TeleLife  questionnaire and knowledge.
- Azure Key Vault  secures secrets, while container images are deployed through  Azure Container Registry  with GitHub CI/CD.
- A lightweight  Web Client  supports PoC testing without requiring integration to production telephony.
- Fully  Azure-native , low latency, modular, and expandable, providing a scalable foundation for future Protective integrations.

## Assumptions for Proof-of-Concept Foundations {#slide-13}

© Capgemini 2025. All rights reserved.

13

Azure Ecosystem

Environment runs on Capgemini-provided Azure environment with licenses for OpenAI, Speech, Communication Services, and Copilot Studio

No-Connection Setup

Development and testing in an isolated (sandbox) environment

Feasibility Focus

Focused on technical feasibility, not production scalability

Limited Scope

Proof-of-Concept demonstrates one functional call flow for Telelife application

Structured Data Input

TeleLife  questionnaire converted into JSON or Dataverse format

Data Privacy

Only synthetic or anonymized data used during Proof-of-Concept

Assumptions validated by Protective to guide Proof-of-Concept scope and environment readiness

Q2: How should the system behave when the user interrupts? Are there mandatory compliance or disclosure statements that must be delivered without interruption?

 

Q3: Is the Proof-of-Concept measured primarily on full interview completion without human intervention, or on the accuracy of captured responses? How is accuracy measured?

Q1: When users provide vague or incomplete answers,  (e.g., "a small blue pill for my heart"),  is the assistant expected to probe and cross-reference internal databases, or simply capture the ambiguity as stated?

Q4: Will sessions always involve a single caller, or might additional participants join? (e.g., spouse, agent) Multi-speaker scenarios significantly affect dereliction and scope.

Questions structured to validate assumptions, clarify dependencies, and confirm readiness for Proof-Of-Concept launch  (to be discussed shortly pre- or during kick-off)

## Helpful upfront information {#slide-15}

Next Steps

Protective Proof-of-Concept Discussion \| November 2025

## After a successful Proof-of-Concept Protective should aim to maximize Containment and Experience {#slide-17}

Automate structured interviews  while maintaining compliance and empathy

Validate AI performance  using sandbox and synthetic data before production

Build an orchestration layer  with Azure + Capgemini + Protective for full-scale rollout

Today

Manual, Form-Based Interview Model

- TeleLife  interviews are  fully human-led  and  follow structured scripts  over phone calls
- Agents  manually capture responses  and summarize them for downstream processing
- Interview  durations are long , with  limited ability to validate  or reuse captured data.
- Experience is inconsistent ; performance depends heavily on interviewer skill.

H1 2026 Focus

Shift to an AI-Augmented, Assisted-Interview Strategy

- Conversational AI automates  large portions of  TeleLife  interviews via phone and other channels, following the standard questionnaire
- Human oversight is retained  for validation, escalation and empathy cues
- Evolve existing tech stack  for large scale deployment of AI across multiple processes

North Star      

Omnichannel, Predictive Engagement Model

- Knowledge AI dynamically guides interviews  using contextual memory and prior responses
- Predictive routing and personalization  tailor interview flows based on applicant profile and risk
- Voice AI collaborate to deliver  empathetic, compliant, and adaptive conversations
- AI Agent Assist features  reduce manual effort and accelerate quote-to-bind

Net new slides:

Refine scope

Start info collection -- have something that defines what expected outcome of these interviews are. We need documents on  xyz  and speak to people on same topics. Highlight anything that's crit dependency on them.

View on tech architecture

Define way of working -- weekly update... biweekly update = end of sprint. If you want, can be a part of sprint planning as well. TBD. Make table/calendar view and decide which involved in. 

Align on next steps -- deep dive into first sprint. Setting up for success. 

Also want to plan ahead and start thinking  - assume great success, what does leadership need in order to invest behind this. "one of the things that human salespeople do while on phone -- not just collecting info, but assessing people."

WORK BACKWARDS FROM EXEC SUM -- back of env.  Bizcase  (current  opex  v. future  opex )

## Our Approach {#slide-19}

- Summarize the PoC details, as well as considerations from interviews and workshops into an executive summary document (up to 25 pages) for leadership socialization and initiating next steps on the AI journey.
