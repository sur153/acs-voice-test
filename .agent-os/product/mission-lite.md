# Product Mission (Lite)

TeleLife Conversational AI is a voice-based automation system that helps Protective Life Insurance conduct structured underwriting interviews through an AI agent capable of phone conversations.

The POC focuses on automating 2-3 representative medical scenarios (Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Cardiovascular) covering 20 questions with complex branching logic. The goal is to demonstrate technical feasibility for AI-assisted interviews that can scale to the full ~5,000 question set while maintaining compliance, decision accuracy, and natural conversation flow.

Key outcomes: validate voice automation feasibility, provide measurable insights on process fit for AI, and identify prerequisites for scaled deployment.
